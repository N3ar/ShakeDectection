# ShakeDectection
This Android project was done as part of an assignment for Cornell's INFO 6120 - Ubiquitous Computing. A first attempt at any mobile application. It serves as a simple exercise to familiarizing the coder with application structure, how to take advantage of available hardware, and a good Java refresher.

Goals:
- Create an application in Android Studio
- Application displays linear acceleration data on button press
- Application indicates if the phone is being shaken
- Application provides atmospheric pressure on button press
